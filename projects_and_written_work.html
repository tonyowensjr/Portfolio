        <p  style="margin-left:2%; font-size:20px; color: black;">For my Senior Thesis, I am building a Markov Model to simulate the results of MLB games.
            The model uses data from <a>Retrosheet</a> which includes play-by-play data I can use to determine the start and end state for each at-bat. The 
            model is written in Python and I use R to acquire the Retrosheet data with the BaseballR package. In addition to the model, the project will have an
            interactive front-end which allows the user to visualize the results of each simulation.

            word expansion of this paper for completion of the independent work component of my certificate in Spanish Language and Culture at Princeton University.

             In addition to using the provided data, I used the Python nltk library to perform sentiment analysis on the title and description and the Consumer Price Index and inflation rate for the year the movie was released. The final model was a Scikit-learn 
             random forest regressor model. I placed 2nd in the competition out of around 30 participants.

            present our findings to a panel of coaches. For this project, I used SQL to query our data and extract relevant information regarding the Chiefs and their opponents. I also used Python to assist with data 
            cleaning and the visualization of our results.
